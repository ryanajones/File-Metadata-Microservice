Receive metadata information about a certain file. Uploading a file will return a JSON response of the file's name, size, and type. Node and Express are used on the back-end to route HTTP requests. Within the POST handler function, a Node.js middleware called 'Multer' is envoked on the file to pull the metadata data for a JSON response.
